# react-landing-pages
This repo contains a collection of landing pages written in React.js. At the moment, I have only one landing page, but I'm hoping that with time, I'll have converted (or reactified) a few landing pages that I find on the web. The goal is that you can clone this project, use one of the landing page that you like, modify it, and get your own web app up and running in no time.

# Introduction

  a) React.js (also using React router)
